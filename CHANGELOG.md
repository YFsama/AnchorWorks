## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-01

A print-and-cut release: the vinyl-cutter pipeline grows to near parity with
desktop sign software, plus a richer right-click menu, more shortcuts, and a
beefed-up debug panel.

### Added — Document
- **Paper-size presets** for the artboard: print (A3–A6, Letter, Legal,
  Tabloid), cards & photo, stickers & labels, and screen/social sizes, with
  DPI-aware mm⇄px conversion, an orientation toggle, and a live physical-size
  readout.

### Added — Cutter / plotter
- **Visual cut preview** — true-scale SVG of the blade path with
  registration/positioning marks and an optional printed-art overlay, so a job
  is verifiable before sending (not just raw G-code/HP-GL text).
- **Cut by colour** — contours record their source swatch; mute colours to cut
  one vinyl colour at a time. Registration marks and weed borders always cut.
- **HTV mirror**, **greedy cut-order optimisation**, and a live **job estimate**
  (cut length / pen-up travel / time / path count).
- **Overcut** for clean closed-path corners, generalised to all dialects.
- **Weed border** plus an optional **weed grid** (rows × columns).
- **Material presets** (vinyl / HTV / sticker / cardstock / tint / stencil) that
  fill speed/force/overcut and auto-enable mirror for HTV.
- **Test cut** calibration pattern to dial in force/offset on scrap.

### Added — Editing & navigation
- **Right-click menu**: Paste Here (at cursor), Flip Horizontal/Vertical,
  Edit Text, Cut Contour…, Send to Plotter…, Select All.
- **Shortcuts**: `Ctrl+2` Zoom to Selection, `Ctrl+Shift+P` Send to Plotter.

### Added — Debug
- Live **FPS** meter, a **keymap** snapshot tab, cut-path totals, app
  version/shell, and one-click **Copy / Download diagnostics** (a structured
  JSON bug-report blob).

### Changed
- The cutter's "needs Chrome" gate is reframed: **Save File** works in any
  browser and is the primary action when direct USB (Tauri native or Web
  Serial) is unavailable.

### Notes
- New pure modules `cutOptimize.ts` and `paperSizes.ts` ship with unit tests
  (25 cases across the two). Full en/zh translations. tsc + eslint + vitest
  (180) + vite build all green.
